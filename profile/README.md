## 🌟 Introduction

### 🤔 What is DARP?

DARP (Decentralized Agent and Resource Protocol) is project to evolve agentic LLM systems into self-organized AI companies capabale of much more than a single LLM even with a lot of tools. One of the core parts of this effort is extensions to MCP protocol that make it easy to implement such systems.

✨ Special thanks to Anthropic and the community for the foundational MCP protocol that made DARP possible.

This project is in early stages of development.
